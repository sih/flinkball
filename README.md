# FlinkBall

## Overview
This uses the [Teleprinter project on this repo](https://github.com/sih/teleprinter) to provide a stream of football results from the Premier League years - actually provides both Premiership and Championship results so we are able to track West Ham's illustrious progress over the years.

## To Do
- Basic stats on a team
- Date-based stats, e.g.
  - Goals per week / month
  - Goals per day of week
  - etc.   
-  What-if scenarios where results are altered (e.g. ABU weighting)
